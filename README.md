Objectives:

For our final project, we want to investigate how the pandemic affected public health and safety in other indirect ways. We are using datasets from ‘Data for A Pandemic of Mental Health’ [1]. The key questions we are addressing are: how did the pandemic impact gun violence in America and which demographics were most impacted concerning mental health, depression, and anxiety? 

Methodology:

The statistical techniques we will be using are: Data Collection and Preparation, Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical and Comparative Analysis, Visualization, and Storytelling. 

Issues addressed:

How the pandemic stress impacted mental health: the pandemic caused intense stress due to isolation, financial struggles, and uncertainty. This project addresses how stress manifests in various populations and the degree to which it impacts mental health.
Demographic disparities in mental health outcomes: certain groups like young adults, low-income individuals, and healthcare workers may have experienced the pandemic’s impact on mental health more than others. This project aims to dig deeper into the differences and explore the challenges and reasons behind these disparities.
The pandemic’s influence on gun violence in America: through this project, we aim to understand how pandemic-related stress and social changes affected gun violence patterns in the U.S., including shifts in the frequency and the communities affected.
